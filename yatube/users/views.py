    # In basic Django's PasswordResetView when email has mistake
    # or doesn't exsist no email will be sent, but the user wonâ€™t
    # receive any error message either.
    # This prevents information leaking to potential attackers.
    # If you want to provide an error message in this case,
    # you can subclass PasswordResetForm and use the form_class attribute.
